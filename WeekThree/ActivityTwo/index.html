                The world wide web began as text-only medium-the first browsers <br />
                didn't even support images within web pages. Although it's still not <br />
                quite ready togive televsion a run for its money, the Web has come <br />
                long way since then.

                In the world of science fiction movies computers are often seen obeying <br />
                commands in English. Although this might indeed happen in the near <br />
                future, computers currently find it easier to understand languages such <br />
                as BASIC, C and Java.

                If you know how to use XHTML to create a web document you've already <br />
                worked with one computer language. You use XHTML tags to describe how <br />
                you want your document formatted, and the browser obeys your commands <br />
                and show the formatted document to the user.

            <h2># Scripts and Programs</h2>

            <p>
                A movie or a play follows a script - a list of actions (or lines) for the <br />
                actors to perform. A web script provides the same type of instructions for <br />
                a web browser. A script in JavaScript can range from a single line to a <br />
                full-scale application.

            <h2># History of Java</h2>

            <p>
                JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation, the maker <br />
                of the Netscape web browser. JavaScript was the first web scripting language <br />
                to be supported by browsers, and is still by far the most popular.
